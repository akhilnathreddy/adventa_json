This results in the total vapor pressure of the solution being lower than what would be predicted by Raoult's law for an ideal solution. Thus, **VP decreases**.\n2.  **Boiling Point (BP):** The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the external atmospheric pressure. Since the solution's vapor pressure is lowered, more heat energy is required to raise its vapor pressure to the level of the external pressure. Consequently, the boiling point of the solution is higher than that of an ideal solution.

[cite: 83] [cite_start]The overall nature of the solution depends on the relative extent of hydrolysis of the cation and the anion, which in turn depends on the dissociation constant of the weak base ($K_b$) and the weak acid ($K_a$).\n* If $K_b > K_a$, the solution is basic.\n* If $K_a > K_b$, the solution is acidic.\n* If $K_a \\approx K_b$, the solution is approximately neutral.\nThis statement is a fundamental principle of salt hydrolysis, and it is **true**. [cite: 83, 84][cite_start]\n\n**Analysis of Statement-1:**\nStatement-1 claims that ammonium carbonate, $(NH_4)_2CO_3$, is basic. [cite: 82] This salt is formed from a weak base, ammonium hydroxide ($NH_4OH$), and a weak acid, carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$). To verify the statement, we apply the principle from Statement-2.\n* The dissociation constant for the base, $K_b$ of $NH_4OH$, is approximately $1.8 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n* The dissociation constant for the acid, $K_{a1}$ of $H_2CO_3$, is approximately $4.5 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\nComparing the values, we find that $K_b (1.8 \\times 10^{-5}) > K_a (4.5 \\times 10^{-7})$. Since the dissociation constant of the base is greater than that of the acid, the hydrolysis of the carbonate ion ($CO_3^{2-}$) will produce more $OH^-$ ions than the hydrolysis of the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$) produces $H^+$ ions. This leads to an overall basic solution. [cite_start]Therefore, Statement-1 is **true**. [cite: 82, 84]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth statements are true, and Statement-2 provides the precise scientific reasoning required to determine that Statement-1 is true. Hence, Statement-2 is the correct explanation for Statement-1.",

[cite: 135][cite_start]\n* Moles of O₂ = Volume at STP / 22400 ml/mol = $5600 / 22400 = 0.25$ mol. [cite: 139]\n* The half-reaction for the liberation of oxygen is $2O^{2-} \\rightarrow O_2 + 4e^-$. The number of electrons transferred per mole of O₂ is 4. Thus, the n-factor for O₂ is 4.\n* Gram equivalents of O₂ = moles of O₂ × n-factor = $0.25 \\times 4 = 1$ eq.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mass of Ag.**\n* Since the gram equivalents of Ag must be equal to the gram equivalents of O₂, we have:\n    Gram equivalents of Ag = 1 eq.\n* The half-reaction for the deposition of silver is $Ag^+ + e^- \\rightarrow Ag$. [cite_start]The n-factor for Ag is 1.\n* The equivalent mass of Ag = Molar mass / n-factor = 108 g/mol / 1 = 108 g/eq.\n* The formula for gram equivalents is also: Gram equivalents = Mass / Equivalent mass.\n* Let W be the mass of silver displaced.\n    $1 = \\frac{W}{108}$ [cite: 139][cite_start]\n* Solving for W gives:\n    $W = 108$ g.

        "solution": "The ability of an element to show variable oxidation states depends on its electronic configuration and electronegativity.\n\n1.  **Fluorine (F):** Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the entire periodic table. [cite_start]Due to its extremely high electronegativity, it only exhibits an oxidation state of -1 in its compounds (and 0 in its elemental form, $F_2$). [cite: 156] Furthermore, its valence shell is the second shell (n=2), which does not have any d-orbitals. This prevents fluorine from expanding its octet to form more than one bond, so it cannot show positive oxidation states like +1, +3, +5, or +7.\n\n2.  **Other Halogens (Cl, Br, I):** Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine are also highly electronegative, but less so than fluorine. They can exhibit an oxidation state of -1 when bonded to a less electronegative element. However, when bonded to a more electronegative element (like oxygen or fluorine), they can show positive oxidation states. They have vacant d-orbitals in their valence shells (n=3 for Cl, n=4 for Br, etc.), which allows them to accommodate more than eight electrons (expand their octet). [cite_start]This enables them to exhibit variable oxidation states such as +1, +3, +5, and +7 (e.g., in oxides and interhalogen compounds).\n\nTherefore, fluorine ($F_2$) is the only halogen that does not show variable oxidation states.

This carbocation is trigonal planar and $sp^2$ hybridized. In the second step, the nucleophile can attack this planar intermediate from either the top face or the bottom face with nearly equal probability.

This mixture is called a racemic mixture, and the process is known as **racemisation**.\n\n* **$S_N2$ Reaction:** This reaction occurs in a single, concerted step. The nucleophile attacks the substrate from the side directly opposite to the leaving group (a 'backside attack'). This causes the configuration of the carbon atom to invert, much like an umbrella flipping inside out in a strong wind. This stereochemical outcome is called **inversion of configuration** (or Walden inversion).\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that $S_N1$ reactions lead to racemisation and $S_N2$ reactions lead to inversion.",

        "solution": "The enol content of a carbonyl compound depends on the stability of its enol tautomer. The enol form is stabilized by factors like conjugation and intramolecular hydrogen bonding.\n\n1.  **Pentane-2,4-dione (Acetylacetone - Option A):** This is a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound. Its α-hydrogens (on C-3) are highly acidic. The resulting enol is exceptionally stable due to two main reasons:\n    * **Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding:** The -OH group of the enol forms a hydrogen bond with the other carbonyl oxygen, creating a stable six-membered ring.\n    * **Conjugation:** The C=C double bond is in conjugation with the C=O double bond, which provides resonance stabilization.\n    \n\n2.  **Ethyl 3-oxobutanoate (Ethyl acetoacetate - Option B):** This is a β-keto ester. It also exhibits tautomerism and its enol is stabilized by conjugation and H-bonding. However, the stabilization is less effective than in acetylacetone.\n\n3.  **Pentane-2,5-dione (Option C):** This is a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound. The carbonyl groups are too far apart, so there is no special stabilization for the enol form via conjugation between the groups or intramolecular H-bonding.\n\n4.  **Butan-2-one (Option D):** This is a simple ketone. Its enol content is very low as there are no significant stabilizing factors other than hyperconjugation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Due to the combined effects of resonance-stabilized conjugation and the formation of a stable six-membered ring via intramolecular hydrogen bonding, pentane-2,4-dione (acetylacetone) has the most stable enol form and therefore the highest enol content among the choices.",

However, the molecule has a symmetrical tetrahedral shape. The four bond dipoles are oriented symmetrically in space and cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero. Thus, $CCl_4$ is **nonpolar**.\n* **B) $CHCl_3$ (Chloroform):** This molecule also has a tetrahedral geometry. It has three polar C-Cl bonds and one C-H bond. Since hydrogen is much less electronegative than chlorine, the bond dipoles do not cancel each other out. There is a net dipole moment, making $CHCl_3$ a **polar** molecule.\n* **C) $CH_2=CH_2$ (Ethene):** This molecule is planar and completely symmetrical. The C-H bonds have very low polarity, and the overall symmetry ensures that it is **nonpolar**.\n* **D) $CO_2$ (Carbon dioxide):** The C=O bonds are highly polar. However, the molecule has a linear and symmetrical geometry. The two bond dipoles are equal in magnitude but point in opposite directions, so they cancel out completely.

This indicates a **free-radical addition** mechanism, which proceeds with **anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity**.\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material has two double bonds and one existing chiral center (at C4, the carbon holding the isopropyl group).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** The reaction will occur at one of the double bonds. As shown in the provided solution diagram, the addition takes place across the endocyclic (inside the ring) double bond. (While the exocyclic double bond is generally more reactive, we will follow the path shown in the problem's solution).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The key to this problem is understanding the creation of new chiral centers. The original double bond was between C1 and C2, which are not chiral. After the addition of H and Br, both C1 and C2 become new chiral centers. Let's denote them as C1* and C2*.\n\n4.  **Counting the Products:**\n    * We start with a molecule that has one chiral center (C4).\n    * The reaction creates two new chiral centers (C1* and C2*).\n    * When a reaction creates new chiral centers in a molecule that is already chiral, diastereomers are formed.\n    * For each configuration of the starting material (e.g., R-limonene), the addition can create four different combinations of the new chiral centers: (R,S at C1/C2), (S,R at C1/C2), (R,R at C1/C2), and (S,S at C1/C2). However, due to the mechanism and structure, two new chiral centers will lead to $2^2 = 4$ possible stereoisomers.\n    * Starting from a single enantiomer at C4, the formation of two new chiral centers at C1 and C2 will produce a mixture of **four diastereomers**.\n\nTherefore, a total of 4 products (stereoisomers) are obtained.",

The phenoxide ion is more reactive towards electrophilic substitution than phenol itself.\n2.  Chloroform ($CHCl_3$) and NaOH react to form a highly reactive electrophile, dichlorocarbene (:$CCl_2$).\n3.  The dichlorocarbene attacks the electron-rich benzene ring of the phenoxide ion, preferentially at the ortho position due to stabilization. This forms an intermediate.\n4.  [cite_start]Finally, hydrolysis of the intermediate in an acidic medium ($H^+, H_2O$) replaces the dichloromethyl group with an aldehyde group (-CHO).

To arrange the compounds by $pK_a$, we must first determine their relative acidic strengths.\n\n1.  **Ethanol (d)**: An aliphatic alcohol. [cite_start]The conjugate base, ethoxide ($C_2H_5O^-$), is destabilized by the electron-donating (+I) effect of the ethyl group, making ethanol the weakest acid (highest $pK_a$). [cite: 122]\n2.  [cite_start]**Phenol (a)**: More acidic than ethanol because its conjugate base, the phenoxide ion, is stabilized by the delocalization of the negative charge over the benzene ring through resonance. [cite: 119]\n3.  **Meta-nitrophenol (b)**: The electron-withdrawing nitro group (-$NO_2$) at the meta position exerts a -I (inductive) effect, pulling electron density from the ring. This stabilizes the phenoxide ion, making it more acidic than phenol. [cite_start]The resonance (-R) effect does not operate from the meta position. [cite: 120]\n4.  **Para-nitrophenol (c)**: The -$NO_2$ group at the para position exerts both a strong -I effect and a strong -R (resonance) effect. The -R effect allows the negative charge of the phenoxide ion to be delocalized onto the nitro group, providing significant extra stabilization. [cite_start]This makes p-nitrophenol the strongest acid in the group (lowest $pK_a$). [cite: 121]\n\nThe order of increasing acidity is: Ethanol < Phenol < Meta-nitrophenol < Para-nitrophenol (d < a < b < c).\n\nSince $pK_a$ is inversely proportional to acidity, the order of decreasing $pK_a$ is the reverse of the acidity order.

The required alkyl halide is 1-chloropropane ($CH_3CH_2CH_2Cl$). The propynide anion attacks the primary carbon of 1-chloropropane, displacing the chloride ion. So, reagent 'B' is $CH_3CH_2CH_2Cl$.",

        "solution": "Let's analyze both statements individually before assessing the relationship between them.\n\n### Assertion (A)\nThis statement describes the trend of covalent radii in Group 15. There is a substantial increase in radius from Nitrogen (N) to Phosphorus (P) as a new electron shell is added. [cite: 207] [cite_start]However, from Arsenic (As) down to Bismuth (Bi), the increase in radius is much smaller than expected. [cite: 207, 260] This is a well-documented observation. [cite_start]The reason for the small increase in heavier elements is the poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner, completely filled d-orbitals (in As, Sb) and f-orbitals (in Bi). [cite: 261] This effect, known as transition/lanthanide contraction, increases the effective nuclear charge felt by valence electrons, contracting the atom's size. [cite_start]Thus, **Assertion (A) is a correct statement**. [cite: 255][cite_start]\n\n--- \n\n### Reason (R)\nThis statement says that covalent and ionic radii generally increase down a group. [cite: 208, 259] This is the fundamental periodic trend, caused by the addition of a new principal energy level (electron shell) for each period, which outweighs the increase in nuclear charge. [cite_start]Thus, **Reason (R) is also a correct statement**. [cite: 253]\n\n--- \n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements (A) and (R) are factually correct. However, Reason (R) states the general rule, while Assertion (A) describes a specific case where the general rule is partially counteracted by another effect (poor shielding). The general rule (R) does not explain the *exception* (the small increase from As to Bi) mentioned in (A). The correct explanation for the phenomenon in (A) is the d- and f-block contraction. [cite_start]Therefore, **(R) is not the correct explanation of (A)**. [cite: 253]",

The experimental dipole moment of ammonia ($NH_3$) is approximately 1.46 D, whereas the dipole moment for nitrogen trifluoride ($NF_3$) is only about 0.24 D. Thus, $NH_3$ has a significantly higher dipole moment than $NF_3$.\n\n**Statement II:** This statement is false. The direction of electron flow (bond dipoles) is not uniform. In $NH_3$, nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the N-H bond dipoles point towards nitrogen. The orbital dipole of the lone pair also points away from the nitrogen atom, in the same general direction as the resultant of the bond dipoles. These vectors add together, resulting in a large net dipole moment. In contrast, in $NF_3$, fluorine is more electronegative than nitrogen. Therefore, the N-F bond dipoles point away from the nitrogen towards the fluorine atoms. The orbital dipole of the lone pair points in the opposite direction to the resultant of the three N-F bond dipoles.

    "solution": "Let's evaluate each statement based on the periodic trends of Group 16 hydrides.\n\n**Statement I:** This statement is **correct**. The acidic strength of the hydrides of Group 16 elements ($H_2O, H_2S, H_2Se, H_2Te$) increases down the group. This is because the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the H–E bond decreases as the size of the central atom (E) increases. A lower BDE means the bond is weaker, and the proton ($H^+$) can be donated more readily. [cite_start]Thus, $H_2Te$ is a stronger acid than $H_2S$. [cite: 262]\n\n**Statement II:** This statement is **incorrect**. The Bond Dissociation Enthalpy (BDE) is the energy required to break a bond. As we move down Group 16 from Sulfur to Tellurium, the atomic size increases. This results in a longer and weaker H–E bond due to less effective orbital overlap. [cite_start]Therefore, the BDE of $H_2Te$ is lower than that of $H_2S$. [cite: 262]\n\nSince Statement I is correct and Statement II is incorrect, the correct option is (d).",

    "solution": "NaCl is a strong electrolyte, dissociating into $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ ions. The van't Hoff factor (i) indicates the number of particles a solute forms in solution. \n There are two ways to interpret this: \n 1.  **Ideal Assumption:** Often, for introductory chemistry problems, strong electrolytes are assumed to dissociate completely (100%) regardless of concentration. Under this assumption, one unit of NaCl always produces two ions, so $i = 2$ for all samples. This would mean $i_1 = i_2 = i_3$. \n 2.  **Real Solution Behavior:** In reality, the dissociation of even strong electrolytes is not 100% perfect, especially at higher concentrations, due to attractions between the positive and negative ions. As the solution is diluted (concentration decreases), the ions move farther apart, reducing these inter-ionic attractions. This leads to a more complete dissociation. Therefore, the degree of dissociation, and consequently the van't Hoff factor, increases as the concentration decreases. \n The concentrations are: Sample 1 (0.1M) > Sample 2 (0.01M) > Sample 3 (0.001M). \n Based on real behavior, the van't Hoff factors would follow the opposite trend: $i_3 > i_2 > i_1$. This is the physically correct answer. The provided exam key might have used the ideal assumption, but understanding the effect of dilution is crucial.",
