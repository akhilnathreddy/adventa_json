The presence of a double bond makes it 'heptene'.\n3.  **Number the parent chain**: The chain is numbered starting from the carbon of the carboxylic acid group as C-1. This places the double bond between C-6 and C-7, so it is a 'hept-6-ene'.\n4.  **Identify and locate substituents**: The substituents are named and located as follows:\n    - An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at the C-2 position.

    "solution": "### Analysis of Statements\n\n**Statement-A**: This statement compares the dipole moments of ammonia ($NH_3$) and nitrogen trifluoride ($NF_3$). Both molecules have a trigonal pyramidal shape due to a lone pair on the nitrogen atom. Experimentally, the dipole moment of $NH_3$ is approximately 1.47 D, whereas for $NF_3$ it is only about 0.23 D. Thus, **Statement-A is correct**. \n\n**Statement-R**: This statement provides an explanation for the observation in Statement-A.\n* In **$NH_3$**, nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen. Therefore, the bond dipoles of the three N-H bonds point from H towards N. The lone pair on nitrogen creates an orbital dipole moment that also points away from the nucleus, in the same general direction as the vector sum of the bond moments. These two effects add up, resulting in a large overall dipole moment.\n* In **$NF_3$**, fluorine is more electronegative than nitrogen. The bond dipoles of the three N-F bonds point from N towards F. The orbital dipole from the lone pair points away from the nitrogen, but the vector sum of the three strong N-F bond moments points in the opposite direction. The two vectors largely cancel each other out, leading to a very small net dipole moment.\n\nTherefore, **Statement-R is correct** and it accurately explains why the dipole moment of $NF_3$ is smaller than that of $NH_3$.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince both statements are correct and Statement-R provides the correct reasoning for Statement-A, option A is the correct choice.",

Since $x < 0$, $3x$ is negative, so $3x-1$ is also negative. Therefore, $|3x - 1| = -(3x-1) = 1-3x$. This is a linear function with a slope of -3, so it is strictly decreasing.

Minimizing this expression is equivalent to minimizing the squared distance between P and Q.\n\n2.  **Identify the Curve**: Let's determine the path of point Q. We have $y = \\sqrt{-x^2+8x-7}$. For this to be defined, the term under the square root must be non-negative. Squaring both sides gives:\n    $y^2 = -x^2+8x-7$\n    Rearranging the terms: $x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 7 = 0$\n    Complete the square for the x-terms: $(x^2 - 8x + 16) - 16 + y^2 + 7 = 0$\n    $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 9 = 3^2$\n    This is the equation of a circle with center $C(4, 0)$ and radius $r=3$.

But the starting material is 1,2-dimethyl. So H from C-6 gives 1,6-dimethylcyclohexene. No, that's not right. The double bond would be between C1 and C6. The product would be 1,6-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me re-verify. Product is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. Removing H from C-2 gives a double bond between C1-C2. Product name is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. Correct. Removing H from C-6 gives a double bond between C1-C6. Product name is 1,6-dimethylcyclohexene. Correct. Let's call this option B.

This is a decreasing line from $f(-3)=70$ to $f(7)=50$.\n\nFor $x > 7$, the function is $f(x) = 5(x+3) + 7(x-7) = 12x-34$, which is increasing.\nFor $x < -3$, the function is $f(x) = 5(-(x+3)) + 7(-(x-7)) = -12x+34$, which is decreasing.\n\nThe minimum value of the function occurs at $x=7$, and the minimum value is $f_{min}=50$.\n\nWe are asked to solve the equation $f(x) = 5$. Since the minimum value of $f(x)$ is 50, it can never be equal to 5.\nTherefore, there are **no solutions** to the equation.",

    "solution": "The primary reason for the hanging metal chain is **electrical safety**.\n\nAs a large vehicle like a tanker truck moves, it experiences friction with the air. The tires rolling on the road and the sloshing of the liquid inside can also generate static electricity, causing a significant amount of electric charge to build up on the truck's metal body. \n\nIf this accumulated static charge were to discharge suddenly in the form of a spark, it could ignite the flammable vapors from the liquid being transported, leading to a fire or explosion.\n\nThe metal chain provides a continuous conductive path from the truck's body to the ground. This process is known as **grounding** or **earthing**. It allows the excess static charge to flow safely and continuously from the truck to the Earth, which can absorb the charge without a significant change in potential. This prevents the buildup of a large potential difference and eliminates the risk of a dangerous spark. Therefore, the chain is there so that excess charge can be transferred to the earth.",

The lengths of the intercepts on the axes are $OA = 4+9/m$ and $OB = |-9-4m| = 9+4m$.\n$Area(m) = \\frac{1}{2} (4 + \\frac{9}{m})(9 + 4m) = \\frac{1}{2} (36 + 16m + \\frac{81}{m} + 36) = \\frac{1}{2} (72 + 16m + \\frac{81}{m})$.\nTo find the minimum area, we can use the AM-GM inequality on the terms $16m$ and $\\frac{81}{m}$.\nFor positive numbers, $AM \\ge GM$, so $\\frac{16m + \\frac{81}{m}}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{16m \\cdot \\frac{81}{m}}$.\n$16m + \\frac{81}{m} \\ge 2\\sqrt{16 \\times 81} = 2 \\times 4 \\times 9 = 72$.\nThe minimum value of $16m + \\frac{81}{m}$ is 72.\n\nSubstituting this minimum value back into the area formula:\n$Area_{min} = \\frac{1}{2} (72 + 72) = \\frac{1}{2} (144) = 72$.\nTherefore, the minimum area of triangle OAB is 72 square units.",

    "solution": "This problem is based on Werner's theory of coordination compounds.\n\nStep 1: Determine the structure of the complex.\nThe reaction with excess silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$) is used to determine the number of ionizable chloride ions (i.e., those outside the coordination sphere). The problem states that 1 mole of the complex $CoCl_3 \\cdot XNH_3$ reacts to form 2 moles of AgCl precipitate. This implies that there are two chloride ions outside the coordination sphere acting as counter-ions.\n\nThe complex has a total of three chloride atoms. If two are outside, one must be inside the coordination sphere, acting as a ligand.\nTherefore, the formula of the complex can be written as $[Co(NH_3)_x Cl]Cl_2$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the value of x.\nCobalt (Co) most commonly exhibits a coordination number of 6. The ligands inside the coordination sphere are 'x' ammonia molecules and one chloride ion. The total number of ligands must equal the coordination number.\nCoordination Number = (Number of $NH_3$ ligands) + (Number of $Cl^-$ ligands)\n$6 = x + 1$\nSolving for x, we get $x = 5$.\nSo the complete formula for the complex is $[Co(NH_3)_5 Cl]Cl_2$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the oxidation state (n) of Cobalt.\nThe overall charge of the complex is zero. The two chloride counter-ions contribute a total charge of -2. Therefore, the coordination sphere $[Co(NH_3)_5 Cl]$ must have a charge of +2 to balance it.\nLet the oxidation state of Co be 'n'. Ammonia ($NH_3$) is a neutral ligand (charge = 0), and the chloride ligand ($Cl^-$) has a charge of -1.\nThe sum of the oxidation states within the coordination sphere must equal its charge:\n$n + 5(0) + 1(-1) = +2$\n$n - 1 = +2$\n$n = +3$.\nThe oxidation state of cobalt is +3.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the required sum.\nThe question asks for the sum of n and x.\nSum = $n + x = 3 + 5 = 8$.",

The derivative $g'(c)=\\frac{2(1-c^2)}{(c^2-c+1)^2}$ is non-negative for $c \\in [0, 1]$, so the function is increasing on this interval.\nThus, the minimum value of $g(c)$ is 0 and the maximum is 2.

These four groups are different, so C-2 is a chiral center.\n* Carbon-3 is bonded to H, Br, $CH_3$, and the $-CH(Br)CH_3$ group.

However, we must check if the molecule is symmetrical, which could lead to a meso compound.\nThe molecule is symmetrical because the groups attached to C-2 are the same as the groups attached to C-3.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Stereoisomers.**\nDue to the symmetry, we can have a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n1.  **Enantiomers:** These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are the (2R, 3R) and (2S, 3S) isomers. Both of these isomers are chiral and therefore optically active.\n2.  **Meso Compound:** This is the (2R, 3S) isomer.

Their general valence electron configuration is $ns^2 np^1$. They can exhibit oxidation states of +3 and +1.\nAs we move down the group from Ga to Tl, the stability of the lower (+1) oxidation state increases relative to the higher (+3) oxidation state. This is due to the **inert pair effect**. Therefore, Thallium predominantly shows a +1 oxidation state, while for Gallium, the +3 state is much more stable. Indium is intermediate. The order of stability for the +1 oxidation state is indeed $Ga^{+} < In^{+} < Tl^{+}$. \n**Thus, Statement-I is true.**\n\n## Analysis of Statement-II\nThis statement provides the explanation for the trend observed in Statement-I. The **inert pair effect** is the reluctance of the outermost s-electrons to participate in bonding in heavier p-block elements. This occurs because the electrons in the intervening d and f orbitals (present in Ga, In, and Tl) are poor at shielding the outer s-electrons from the pull of the nucleus. This increased effective nuclear charge holds the $ns^2$ electrons more tightly, making them 'inert'. Consequently, only the single $np^1$ electron is readily lost, leading to a stable +1 oxidation state.\n**Thus, Statement-II is the correct explanation and is also true.**\n\n## Conclusion\nBoth Statement-I and Statement-II are true, and Statement-II is the correct reason for Statement-I.",

    "solution": "**Step 1: Simplify the problem with a substitution.**\nLet $w = z+2$. This simplifies the given conditions:\n1. $|w| = 1$\n2. The expression $\\frac{z+1}{z+2}$ becomes $\\frac{(w-2)+1}{w} = \\frac{w-1}{w}$. So, $Im(\\frac{w-1}{w}) = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the conditions to find the components of w.**\nLet $w = x+iy$, where x and y are real numbers.\nFrom the first condition, $|w|=1$, we know that $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=1$, which means $x^2+y^2=1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second condition:\n$\\frac{w-1}{w} = \\frac{(x-1)+iy}{x+iy}$\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n$\\frac{((x-1)+iy)(x-iy)}{(x+iy)(x-iy)} = \\frac{x(x-1) - i(x-1)y + ixy - i^2y^2}{x^2+y^2}$\nSince $x^2+y^2=1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$x^2-x -ixy+iy+ixy+y^2 = (x^2+y^2) - x + iy = 1 - x + iy$.\n\nWe are given that the imaginary part of this expression is $1/5$.\n$Im(1-x+iy) = y = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required value.**\nThe question asks for $|Re(\\overline{z+2})|$.\nUsing our substitution, this is $|Re(\\bar{w})|$.\nSince $w = x+iy$, its conjugate is $\\bar{w} = x-iy$.\nThe real part of $\\bar{w}$ is $Re(\\bar{w}) = x$.\nSo we need to find $|x|$.\n\nUsing the relation $x^2+y^2=1$ and our value for y:\n$x^2 + (\\frac{1}{5})^2 = 1$\n$x^2 + \\frac{1}{25} = 1$\n$x^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{24}{25}$\n$x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{25}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{5} = \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}$.\nFinally, $|x| = |\\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}| = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}$.",
