The presence of a double bond makes it 'heptene'.\n3.  **Number the parent chain**: The chain is numbered starting from the carbon of the carboxylic acid group as C-1. This places the double bond between C-6 and C-7, so it is a 'hept-6-ene'.\n4.  **Identify and locate substituents**: The substituents are named and located as follows:\n    - An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at the C-2 position.

    "solution": "### Analysis of Statements\n\n**Statement-A**: This statement compares the dipole moments of ammonia ($NH_3$) and nitrogen trifluoride ($NF_3$). Both molecules have a trigonal pyramidal shape due to a lone pair on the nitrogen atom. Experimentally, the dipole moment of $NH_3$ is approximately 1.47 D, whereas for $NF_3$ it is only about 0.23 D. Thus, **Statement-A is correct**. \n\n**Statement-R**: This statement provides an explanation for the observation in Statement-A.\n* In **$NH_3$**, nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen. Therefore, the bond dipoles of the three N-H bonds point from H towards N. The lone pair on nitrogen creates an orbital dipole moment that also points away from the nucleus, in the same general direction as the vector sum of the bond moments. These two effects add up, resulting in a large overall dipole moment.\n* In **$NF_3$**, fluorine is more electronegative than nitrogen. The bond dipoles of the three N-F bonds point from N towards F. The orbital dipole from the lone pair points away from the nitrogen, but the vector sum of the three strong N-F bond moments points in the opposite direction. The two vectors largely cancel each other out, leading to a very small net dipole moment.\n\nTherefore, **Statement-R is correct** and it accurately explains why the dipole moment of $NF_3$ is smaller than that of $NH_3$.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince both statements are correct and Statement-R provides the correct reasoning for Statement-A, option A is the correct choice.",

This part of the function is strictly increasing, starting from $h_1(0)=e^0-1=0$.\n    * **For $x < 0$**: The function is $h_2(x) = |3x - 1|$. Since $x < 0$, $3x$ is negative, so $3x-1$ is also negative. Therefore, $|3x - 1| = -(3x-1) = 1-3x$. This is a linear function with a slope of -3, so it is strictly decreasing.

This anomaly is known as the **d-block contraction**. Gallium is the first element after the first transition series (the 3d block).

Minimizing this expression is equivalent to minimizing the squared distance between P and Q.\n\n2.  **Identify the Curve**: Let's determine the path of point Q. We have $y = \\sqrt{-x^2+8x-7}$. For this to be defined, the term under the square root must be non-negative. Squaring both sides gives:\n    $y^2 = -x^2+8x-7$\n    Rearranging the terms: $x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 7 = 0$\n    Complete the square for the x-terms: $(x^2 - 8x + 16) - 16 + y^2 + 7 = 0$\n    $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 9 = 3^2$\n    This is the equation of a circle with center $C(4, 0)$ and radius $r=3$. Because the original equation specified $y = \\sqrt{...}$, y must be non-negative ($y \\ge 0$).

But the starting material is 1,2-dimethyl. So H from C-6 gives 1,6-dimethylcyclohexene. No, that's not right. The double bond would be between C1 and C6. The product would be 1,6-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me re-verify. Product is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. Removing H from C-2 gives a double bond between C1-C2. Product name is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. Correct. Removing H from C-6 gives a double bond between C1-C6. Product name is 1,6-dimethylcyclohexene. Correct. Let's call this option B.

We can find its minimum value to see if it can ever equal 5.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is a convex function, and its minimum value will occur at one of the critical points where the arguments of the absolute value functions are zero. The critical points are $x=-3$ and $x=7$.\n\nLet's evaluate the function at these critical points:\n\n1.  **At x = -3**:\n    $f(-3) = 5|(-3)+3| + 7|(-3)-7|$\n    $f(-3) = 5|0| + 7|-10|$\n    $f(-3) = 0 + 7(10) = 70$.\n\n2.  **At x = 7**:\n    $f(7) = 5|7+3| + 7|7-7|$\n    $f(7) = 5|10| + 7|0|$\n    $f(7) = 5(10) + 0 = 50$.\n\nBetween the two critical points, for $-3 < x < 7$, the function is linear:\n$f(x) = 5(x+3) + 7(-(x-7)) = 5x+15 -7x+49 = -2x+64$. This is a decreasing line from $f(-3)=70$ to $f(7)=50$.\n\nFor $x > 7$, the function is $f(x) = 5(x+3) + 7(x-7) = 12x-34$, which is increasing.\nFor $x < -3$, the function is $f(x) = 5(-(x+3)) + 7(-(x-7)) = -12x+34$, which is decreasing.\n\nThe minimum value of the function occurs at $x=7$, and the minimum value is $f_{min}=50$.\n\nWe are asked to solve the equation $f(x) = 5$. Since the minimum value of $f(x)$ is 50, it can never be equal to 5.\nTherefore, there are **no solutions** to the equation.",

    "solution": "The primary reason for the hanging metal chain is **electrical safety**.\n\nAs a large vehicle like a tanker truck moves, it experiences friction with the air. The tires rolling on the road and the sloshing of the liquid inside can also generate static electricity, causing a significant amount of electric charge to build up on the truck's metal body. \n\nIf this accumulated static charge were to discharge suddenly in the form of a spark, it could ignite the flammable vapors from the liquid being transported, leading to a fire or explosion.\n\nThe metal chain provides a continuous conductive path from the truck's body to the ground. This process is known as **grounding** or **earthing**. It allows the excess static charge to flow safely and continuously from the truck to the Earth, which can absorb the charge without a significant change in potential. This prevents the buildup of a large potential difference and eliminates the risk of a dangerous spark. Therefore, the chain is there so that excess charge can be transferred to the earth.",
