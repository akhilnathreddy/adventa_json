The universal gas constant R is approximately 8.3 J/mol·K.\n6. The temperature (T) is not explicitly stated.

A charge of -2q located at (-5a, 0). The distance of this charge from the origin is 5a. \n 2. A charge of 5q located at (3a, 0). The distance of this charge from the origin is 3a. \n The sphere has a radius of 4a. We need to determine which of these charges are inside the sphere. \n - The charge -2q is at a distance of 5a from the origin, which is greater than the radius of the sphere (4a). Therefore, this charge is outside the sphere. \n - The charge 5q is at a distance of 3a from the origin, which is less than the radius of the sphere (4a). Therefore, this charge is inside the sphere. \n The net charge enclosed by the sphere is just the charge that is inside, so $q_{enclosed} = 5q$. \n Now, we can calculate the flux: \n $\Phi = \\frac{5q}{\\epsilon_0}$ \n The problem states that the flux is $\\frac{xq}{\\epsilon_0}$. \n By comparing the two expressions, we can see that $x=5$.",

To conserve momentum, the atom must recoil in the opposite direction to the emitted photon. \n **Step 1: Calculate the energy of the emitted photon.** \n The transition is from the first excited state ($n_i=2$) to the ground state ($n_f=1$). \n The energy difference is: \n $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = -13.6 \\text{ eV} (\\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{1^2}) = -13.6 (\\frac{1}{4} - 1) = -13.6 (-\\frac{3}{4}) = 10.2$ eV. \n This is the energy of the emitted photon.

Therefore, the final momentum of the system (atom + photon) must also be zero. \n $p_{atom} + p_{photon} = 0 \\implies p_{atom} = -p_{photon}$. \n The magnitudes of their momenta are equal: $|p_{atom}| = |p_{photon}|$. \n $m_H v_{recoil} = p_{photon}$ \n **Step 4: Calculate the recoil speed.** \n $v_{recoil} = \\frac{p_{photon}}{m_H}$ \n Given $m_H = 1.8 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg. \n $v_{recoil} = \\frac{5.44 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg m/s}}{1.8 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}} \\approx 3.02$ m/s. \n Rounding to the nearest integral value, the recoil speed is 3 m/s.",
