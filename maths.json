      "solution": "For the hyperbola x²/16 - y²/9 = 1, we have a_h²=16 and b_h²=9. The eccentricity is e₂ = √(1 + b_h²/a_h²) = √(1 + 9/16) = √(25/16) = 5/4. The foci of the hyperbola are at (±a_h*e₂, 0) = (±4*(5/4), 0) = (±5, 0). Since e₁e₂=1, the eccentricity of the ellipse is e₁ = 1/e₂ = 4/5. The ellipse passes through (5,0), so its major axis must lie along the x-axis. Thus, for the ellipse, the vertices are at (±a_e, 0) and the foci are at (±a_e*e₁, 0). Since the ellipse passes through the hyperbola's foci (±5,0), these points must be the vertices of the ellipse. So, a_e=5. Now we find b_e for the ellipse using b_e² = a_e²(1 - e₁²) = 5²(1 - (4/5)²) = 25(1 - 16/25) = 25(9/25) = 9. So, b_e=3. The equation of the ellipse is x²/25 + y²/9 = 1. To find the length of the chord at y=2, substitute y=2 into the equation: x²/25 + 2²/9 = 1 => x²/25 = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9 => x² = 125/9 => x = ±√(125)/3 = ±5√5/3. The two points are (-5√5/3, 2) and (5√5/3, 2). The length of the chord is the distance between these points, which is 2 * (5√5/3) = 10√5/3.",

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and set it to zero. Let's assume the area is positive, so A(x) = -2x³ + 54x². [cite_start]The derivative is A'(x) = -6x² + 108x[cite: 69]. [cite_start]Setting A'(x) = 0 gives -6x(x - 18) = 0, so the critical points are x=0 and x=18[cite: 69].

We can write this as an equation: 2b = (1/2)(2ae), which simplifies to 2b = ae. [cite_start]Squaring both sides gives 4b² = a²e²[cite: 92, 93]. We use the standard relationship for an ellipse: b² = a²(1 - e²). Now, substitute this expression for b² into our previous equation: 4[a²(1 - e²)] = a²e².
